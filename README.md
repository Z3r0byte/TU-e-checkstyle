# TU/e checkstyle
A configuration file for Checkstyle containing most of the coding conventions of the TU/e. Based off the Google checks template of checkstyle.


As far as I know this has succesfully implemented all rules of the TU/e coding style guidelines. Rule 9 is however not fully working, so make sure to check this yourself. There are also a bunch of other rules from the Google coding standards. These shouldn't conflict with the conventions of the TU/e, but I haven't checked them all.
Please don't rely on this for your style checks, as I cannot guarentee the correctness and compliance of the rules listed in this configuration file.

Pull requests are more than welcome.
